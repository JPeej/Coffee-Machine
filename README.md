<h1 align="center">Coffee Machine</h1>

I was tasked to create a Coffee Machine in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day fifteen of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-Working in IDE.

<h2>What I learned</h2>
Up to this point the class had been using an online tool to write code. This project was to get some experience in using PyCharm. However, I have been working in VSCode since the start. So the lesson was a miss. However, I worked with more functions and nested dictionaries which was a good reinforcement exercise.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
None! Today felt really good.
